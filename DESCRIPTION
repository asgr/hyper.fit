Description: Includes two main high level codes for hyperplane fitting (hyper.fit) and visualising (hyper.plot2d / hyper.plot3d). In simple terms this allows the user to produce robust 1D linear fits for 2D x vs y type data, and robust 2D plane fits to 3D x vs y vs z type data. This hyperplane fitting works generically for any N-1 hyperplane model being fit to a N dimension dataset. All fits include intrinsic scatter in the generative model orthogonal to the hyperplane.
